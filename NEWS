MRSea 0.99.1-beta
-----------

Notes

  * Addition of GEODESIC distance calculation using the `makeDists` function. If you supply a polygon defining an exclusion area, geodesic distances are calculated. 

Bug Fixes

  * Fixed bug in summary and anova functions; term names now correct.
  * `tol` option in runSALSA2D re-instated
  

MRSea 0.99-beta
-----------

Notes

  * Major overhaul of package to include a new model class `gamMRSea`.
  * Update to summary function to allow robust standard errors to be presented and used for hypothesis testing
  * knotgrid for 2D smooth no longer required to be a regular grid
  * calculation of basis radii absorbed into `runSALSA2D` function.
  * predict.gamMRSea function call updated to have same names as predict.glm
  * new cv.gamMRSea function.  This is the cv.glm function from the boot library edited to allow for use with gamMRSea models.
