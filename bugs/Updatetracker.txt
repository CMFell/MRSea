*** Update tracker for MRSea package ***

23/07/2014 	Updated runSALSA2D to take an initial model that is lm or glm
		not updated version. updated github

		included knotdim argument in salsa2dlist in do.bootstrap.cress example

25/07/2014	added new function (predict.cress) to deal with the centering of basis functions 
		when the model is first fitted. 
		not updated package. updated github

** git push **

07/08/2014	changed getCV_CReSS to work if there is no offset in the model
			with geemodel offset always there but all zero so added code to reflect no offset in this case
			also updated to allow for binomial response
		Changed predict.cress to work for binomial data 
			(fakemodel always has poisson response)
		Updated do.bootstrap.cress to work with new predict.cress
		Updated SALSA2D to eliminate duplicates with <1000 data points 
			(in initialise.measures_2d)
		
12/08/2014	Updated QICb to work with binomial family (changed QICb code and inputs)
		Allow CV to return individual fold values
		Corrected parallel bootstrap code to work with new predict.cress function
			meant including extra parameter in predict.cress() now need splineParams
		Also updated bootstrap code to not keep refitting the model when the response 
			does not change (i.e. parametric boostrap only)
		Added error messages to runSALSA2D to stop when:
			a) when min knots or start knots is greater than total valid knot locatiosn
			b) when min, max, start all equal total valid knot locations (SALSA is forced into an error if this occurs)

*** VERSION 0.1.4 *** (requires R 3.1.1)
** git push **




To Do:

1) update getCV_CReSS to allow for binary data (make own cost function) 
2) allow inverse link as option for partial plots and add partial residuals
3) runs profile plots - allow user to specify range of points for plot (e.g. first 300)
4) COVRATIO/PRESS - allow user to keep record of coefficients??
